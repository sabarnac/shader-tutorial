This value is then used to color\n        the pixels that form the individual blocks of a display.\n      </p>\n      <Heading type=\"h2\">How are colors represented in computers?</Heading>\n      <p>\n        Computers represent pixel colors through numbers, and have four color\n        values (or channels) they store per pixel - red channel (R), green\n        channel (G), and blue channel (B). An alpha (transparency) channel (A)\n        can also be used, but is optional.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Generally computers represent each channel using an 8-bit number,\n        resulting in the color of pixel being represented using upto 32 bits\n        total. However, with HDR (high dynamic range) the color of each pixel is\n        represented in at least 30 bits (without alpha), making each channel use\n        a 10-bit number.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The number stored for a particular channel represents the brightness of\n        the color that the channel represents. So if the number for the red\n        channel is 0, that means there is no red in the final color of the\n        pixel. At 255, the red channel is at maximum brightness, showing the\n        brightest red possible.\n      </p>\n      <Heading type=\"h2\">How are colors represented in shaders?</Heading>\n      <p>\n        Colors can be represented using vectors, like vertices. The size of the\n        vector depends on the number of channels that are required to represent\n        the color, with size four providing the most information.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Current computer displays require colors of pixels to be provided with\n        red, green, and blue channels. So colors values that use more or less\n        channels have to be converted into this format. Shaders accept colors\n        with all four channels (RGBA), and then convert that into RGB.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        While each channel of a color is represented as an 8-bit number, in\n        shaders each channel is represented using a 32-bi floating point number.\n        The GPU later converts this to the representation used by computer\n        displays.\n      </p>\n      <Heading type=\"h2\">\n        Why are colors represented as a combination of red, green, and blue?\n      </Heading>\n      <p>\n        Our eyes have three types of \"cones\" that activate when light consists\n        of certain wavelengths of colors - L cone, M cone, and S cone.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The L cones is most sensitive to light of long wavelengths of visible\n        light (hence the name) and, similarly, the M and S cones are sensitive\n        to medium and short wavelengths of visible light respectively.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In the visible light spectrum, red is a color that has a long\n        wavelength, green is a color of medium wavelength, and blue is a color\n        of short wavelength.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This means that when L cones activate, they make our brains see the\n        color red, when M cones activate we see the color green, and when blue\n        cones activate we see the color blue.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This generally allows us to see a wide range of the visible spectrum of\n        light.

It is a 360 degree\n        circle that starts with red at degree 0, then goes to green at the 120\n        degree mark, then to blue at the 240 degree mark, and then wraps back to\n        red at 360 degrees.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This allows all colors to be represented in their bare form, and places\n        complementary colors opposite to each other.\n      </p>\n      <Heading type=\"h3\">Saturation</Heading>\n      <p>\n        Let's take up the example of tea and sugar. When there is no sugar in\n        the tea, the tea tastes just as it is in its pure form. This means that\n        there is 0% concentration of sugar in the tea.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        As sugar is added to the tea, the concentration of sugar increases,\n        which sweetens the tea. Eventually, when the sugar reaches the\n        concentration of 100%, there is no more tea present, meaning that what\n        remains is just sugar.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Saturation is similar in concept, where the tea is the final color, the\n        sugar is the selected hue, and the concentration is the saturation of\n        the hue.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        When there is no hue in the color, the color is white, which is its pure\n        form. As the saturation of the hue increases, the color of the hue adds\n        up more and more to the final color. At 100% saturation, all the remains\n        is the actual color value of the hue.\n      </p>\n      <Heading type=\"h3\">Value/Brightness and Lightness</Heading>\n      <p>\n        Value is similar to saturation, but starts from black. As the value of\n        the hue is increased, the brightness of the color increases, which\n        allows a brighter shade of the color to be shown.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        At full value, the hue is at its highest brightness, which is the raw\n        color of the hue.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        While value/brightness only stops at the final color of the hue, the\n        lightness component can go even brighter and brighter, which makes the\n        hue transform from its raw color into white.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This property allows the color white to be represented in two ways\n        through HSL - by zeroing out saturation or maxing out lightness.\n      </p>\n      <Heading type=\"h2\">Converting between HSV and RGB</Heading>\n      <p>\n        While colors can be created using the HSL or HSV color model/space, this\n        representation needs to be converted into the RGB color model/space,\n        which is what computers understand.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        There are algorithms available online that provide detail on the formula\n        used to perform these conversions as well as functional code that can be\n        used.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <a\n          href=\"https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/59808\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          Here is a Stack Exchange answer\n        </a>{\" \"}\n        that provides GLSL implementations of functions that can convert RGB\n        color to HSV and back again.{\" \"}\n        <a\n          href=\"https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/color/rgb-to-hsv.html\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          This page\n        </a>{\" \"}\n        and{\" \"}\n        <a\n          href=\"https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/color/hsv-to-rgb.html\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          this page\n        </a>{\" \"}\n        show the formula that is used to convert from RGB to HSV and HSV to RGB\n        respectively.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        HSV can be used over HSL as it is generally simpler to understand and\n        use for most people.\n      </p>\n      <Heading type=\"h2\">Additional Notes</Heading>\n      <p>\n        In future chapters, we will primarily work with RGB(A) colors and\n        textures, but this knowledge is available if you wish to work in HSV\n        color-space if it simplifies dealing with color.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Many color pickers and wheels generally provide a HSV-type interface,\n        but also allow exporting results into RGB.

Colors are represented using\n          red, green, and blue channels (optionally with an alpha channel).\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Each channel is generally represented using an 8-bit number, meaning\n          the color of a pixel is represented using 24-bits, or 32-bits\n          (including the alpha channel).\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Although numbers are generally represented using integer numbers, in\n          shaders they are represented using floating point numbers. The\n          conversion from floating point to integer is done by the GPU.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Colors are represented using RGB because it is a form of how humans\n          see color, and is also easy for computers to understand.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          However, RGB colors aren't intuitive for humans to work with.
